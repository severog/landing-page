this is a project to display the layout of a landing page - project via The Odin Project.

# although I finished the project, I am restarting it from scratch.
- I want more practice
- I also want to tidy of some class/id labeling as at it's current state it looks messy.
- Restart date: Oct 16th, 2024.


# project is now finished.. took a few hours (second run through be it though)

# notes:
- I feel like i did a better job at bundling divs together
- I could still use some work on naming classes/id and when to really use them.
- My css still seems clutered and I probably could've assigned rules to a few aspects of the page at the same time.
- In general I feel I did a better job this time around with aligning items on the page. 



# will come back again if I feel neccessary as I work through the course..
